In this fast running world, the entertainment quoties plays a significant factor in the likes of people.They have been categorised into Movies, Local events, Games etc...

Each category has seperate kind of application and have their own booking system. There is no collective repository for all these categories and book them on the go.

Therefore we suggested an application named : TICKET IN POCKET" from which they can select their respective event from a number of categories, select the no of tickets , book them and complete the transaction within one single base application .
